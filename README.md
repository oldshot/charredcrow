\## 🦅 About Charred Crow

Charred Crow is a visual identity shaped by contrast:  

dark vs. light, ash vs. flame, silence vs. presence.



It represents:

\- precision  

\- elegance under pressure  

\- the discipline of creation  

\- the symbolism of rebirth from ember  



Everything here is crafted to preserve the distinct visual voice of the brand.
